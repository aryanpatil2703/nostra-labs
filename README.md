# Nostra Labs – Catalyst

**A Decentralized Web3 Game Lab for Research**

Catalyst is an experimental game inspired by the prisoner’s dilemma. Players stake tokens in rounds managed by our AI host, **MrsBeauty**, while gameplay data informs decentralized science (DeSci) research.

## Architecture

### On-Chain Smart Contracts
Handle staking, round management, fee collection, and reward distribution.

  Dynamically adjusts thresholds and multipliers in real time.
- **Host:**  
  Hosts games via a chatbot interface.

### Web UI

  A vintage-style interface where players connect wallets, stake tokens, and view stats.
- **Live Dashboards:**  
  Provide real-time updates on game rounds, treasury health, and research insights.

## How It Works

1. **Connect & Mint:**  
   Players connect their wallets and mint tokens from a faucet to participate.

2. **Join a Round:**  
   Players stake tokens to enter a round. MrsBeauty sets and adjusts game parameters dynamically.

3. **Play & Strategize:**  
   Participants decide whether to cooperate fully or free ride. The tension between collective cooperation and individual risk mirrors the prisoner’s dilemma, with added intrigue from AI “double agents.”

4. **Win or Lose:**  
   - **Win:**  
     If the threshold is met, the pot is multiplied and the surplus is shared equally among all players.
   - **Lose:**  
     If the threshold is not met, 50% of each player’s stake is burned and the remaining 50% is added to the treasury.

5. **Fuel DeSci:**  
   Staking fees are auto-invested into DeSci projects, and gameplay data is tokenized and shared with the web3 community and researchers.
